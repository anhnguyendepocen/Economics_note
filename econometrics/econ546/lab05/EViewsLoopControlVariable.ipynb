    "### Estimating NLS Models In EViews\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to tell EViews that you wish to estimate the parameters of a model using nonlinear least squares. EViews automatically applies nonlinear least squares to any regression equation that is nonlinear in its coefficients. Simply select **Object/New Object.../Equation**, enter the equation in the equation specification dialog box, and click OK. EViews will do all of the work of estimating your model using an iterative algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specifying Nonlinear Least Squares\n",
    "\n",
    "For nonlinear regression models, you will have to enter your specification in equation form using EViews expressions that contain direct references to coefficients. You may use elements of the default coefficient vector C (e.g. C(1), C(2), C(34), C(87)), or you can define and use other coefficient vectors. For example:\n",

    "## Starting Values\n",
    "Iterative estimation procedures require starting values for the coefficients of the model. The closer to the true values the better, so if you have reasonable guesses for parameter values, these can be useful. In some cases, you can obtain good starting values by estimating a restricted version of the model using least squares. In general, however, you may need to experiment in order to find starting values.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no general rules for selecting starting values for parameters so there are no settings in this page for choosing values. EViews uses the values in the coefficient vector at the time you begin the estimation procedure as starting values for the iterative procedure. It is easy to examine and change these coefficient starting values. To see the current starting values, double click on the coefficient vector in the workfile directory. If the values appear to be reasonable, you can close the window and proceed with estimating your model.\n",
    "\n",

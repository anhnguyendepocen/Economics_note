Adina Popescu: Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:09,450
In this video, we will discuss assessing stationarity and lag lengths.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,060
Once you have estimated a VAR, EViews provides a number of useful tools

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,250
that allow you to improve the specification of the model.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:23,470
As mentioned previously, EViews allows you to check the stability of the VAR

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,970
by providing the inverse roots of the characteristic AR

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,920
polynomial, both in table and graph.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:40,020
The estimated VAR is stationary if all the roots lie inside the unit circle.

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:50,440
So from the VAR window why not go into "View, Lag Structure,"

10
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,520
and one has the option to select "AR Roots Table" or "Graph."

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,270
Let's select Graph.

12
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:05,890
And here we see the inverse roots of the characteristic polynomial.

13
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:12,290
And we can see that they are all inside the unit circle, including this one.

14
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:18,220
Which means that this particular VAR stationary since all roots

15
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,250
lie inside the unit circle.

16
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:26,010
So this is important because if the VAR is not stable,

17
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:31,760
certain results such as impulse response standard errors are not valid.

18
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:41,250
So if the solution to the characteristic polynomial has a root for l equal to 1,

19
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,470
then it means that either some or all of the variables in the VAR process

20
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,790
are integrated of order 1.

21
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,480
It may be also the case that the cointegration between the variables

22
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,410
exists.

23
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,440
And this instance would be better analyzed in the context of the vector error

24
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,480
collection model (VECM).

25
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:09,820
Let me note also that this result can be generated by the command listed here.

26
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:15,360
So also, as we discussed, another important specification in a VAR

27
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,330
is deciding on the number of lags in the system.

28
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:27,070
So opening up our VAR, let's note that EViews offers a number of useful tools

29
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,650
to investigate the lag structure of the VAR.

30
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,830
We can see that by going into "View, Lag Structure."

31
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,590
We can do a lag exclusion test or a lag lengths criteria.

32
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:45,220
Perhaps the most widely used is the lag lengths criteria.

33
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,380
And the lag specification box opens up, which

34
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:55,010
asks us what's the maximum number of lags for which we want to test.

35
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,370
There are no hard rules here, but in general if you have monthly data

36
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:03,010
you may want to set the number of lags to 12 or 24.

37
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,040
If you have quarterly data, four or eight.

38
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,692
Let us select eight.

39
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:13,610
And 1 or 2 for annual data, and then you'll click OK.

40
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,690
The test results are shown here.

41
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,700
So EViews denotes the appropriate lag lengths

42
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,680
for each criterion with an asterisk.

43
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:34,300
In this example, most tests seem to pick two as the appropriate lag length.

44
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:40,230
Although the Schwarz criterion would choose one, and the likelihood ratio

45
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,870
would choose five.

46
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,890
Note that if there are no exogenous variables in the VAR,

47
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,980
the count of the lag would start at one.

48
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,590
Here since we selected the constant, the lag count starts at zero.

49
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,060
Also note that you can replicate the results of these

50
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:05,300
tests by typing in the command window this particular command.

51
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:12,260
On the basis of these results, we would choose two

52
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,580
as the number of lags for the VAR.

53
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:21,940
And then we would re-estimate this VAR with just two lags.

54
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,810


55
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,220
So let me do this here.

56
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,780


57
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,850
And re-estimate the model.

58
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,790


59
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,530
And here we have it.

60
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:45,370


61
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:52,050
Notice that output now shows only two lags for each variable, as we want it.

62
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,630
Thanks a lot for your attention.

Instructions for replicating fm_casestudy2 in R/Rstudio



1.	If R and RStudio are installed on your computer, proceed to step 2.  
	Otherwise, install R and RStudio on your computer from the following links:
		http://www.r-project.org/
		http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop


2. 	Create a project directory "fm_casestudy2" on your computer and
	copy/download/transfer the following files from the OCW website to that directory:
	  (R script files)
		fm_casestudy_0_InstallOrLoadLibraries.r
		fm_casestudy_fx_1.r
		fm_casestudy_2_rcode.r
	  (txt data file)
		fred_fxrates.txt


3.	Open the R-Studio application, and from the top bar of commands 
		a) select Project, then Create Project, then
			Create Project from Existing Directory
		b) with the browser that appears, navigate to select the directory
			"fm_casestudy2"
		   

4.	The R-Studio application opens with a 4-panel display.
		The lower left panel is a console for typing R commands directly or viewing
		output from executed R commands

		The lower right panel has tabs [Files|Plots|Packages|Help]. 
		
		In the lower right panel, select the Files tab and open the 3  R script files			
		from 2, by clicking on the file names, successively

		The files will open in separate tabs in the top left panel.

5.	Go to the first file in the top left panel:
		fm_casestudy_0_InstallOrLoadLibraries.r
	Execute the script file by either
			pressing the 'Source' button at the top tool bar of the file
			highlighting commands in the file and typing Control-Enter
	NOTE: the beginning of the script file has the variable
		ind.install0<-FALSE
	If this is the first time R-studio is using the specific packages in these scripts,
	you will need to change this to ind.install0<-TRUE. 

	Go to the file in the top left panel:
		fm_casestudy_fx1.r
	Execute this script file in the same manner.

	This  file is self documenting explaining
		installing/loading R packages
		basic R commands
		downloading financial data from the internet
		graphing the financial data
		saving an R workspace with data objects



6. 	Go to the third file in the top left panel:
		fm_casestudy_2_rcode.r
	Execute this script file in the same manner as the previous two files.
	This code replicates the r commands in the pdf file classsnotes_casestudy2.pdf

# ECON501 Dyanare Lab


1. download the `startup.m` file to your

`C:\Users\yourname\Documents\MATLAB`

folder.


It can add dynare to matlab path automatically for you.

See more detail https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/startup.html

you can customize your startup file.

2. download sample mod files. 01, 02, and 03.

  * I just found that mod file name cannot start with Numbers such as 01, so I put Numbers such 01 at the end of the file names.

  * ar1 is the an ar1 model.
  * 02 is a New classical model in 02Sargent_Dynare.pdf.
    - The model includes first order conditions which can be found in 501lab9foc_1.pdf.
  * 03 is a New classical model in 03using_dynare_sp17.pdf.

  Both models have deterministic and stochastic versions.


3. matlab handout helps you familiar with MATLAB.

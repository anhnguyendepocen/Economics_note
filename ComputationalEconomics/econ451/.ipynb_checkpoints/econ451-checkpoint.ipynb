    " - Sensitivity analysis is used to demonstrate the robustness of simulation results by varying parameters that may significantly affect the results. As the CGE models encompass structures describing various economic activities in an economy, many parameters (coefficients and exogenous variables) are included.\n",
    " - we have to focus on certain parameters relevant to the objective of our CGE analysis and the key model features that are expected to affect the results most significantly. For example, if we conduct a trade analysis, it is well known that the Armington constant elasticity of substitution (CES) and constant elasticity of transformation (CET) structures should be of primary importance in conducting sensitivity analysis.\n",
    " - Suppose we are simulating the abolition of import tariffs and analysing its impact, particularly on sectoral output. In the case of trade analysis, it is widely known that the elasticity of substitution/transformation in the CES/CET functions is one of the key parameters that can significantly affect the simulation results. By increasing or decreasing the value of this parameter, we can examine the range over which output changes.\n",
    " \n",
    " - After specifying which parameter is to be examined, we have to establish criteria, based on which we can judge the robustness of our simulation results. To evaluate the robustness of the simulation results, we set, for example, the following two criteria:\n",
    "    - Criterion 1: whether the signs of the sectoral output changes are unchanged in all cases, \n",
    "    - Criterion 2: whether the ordering of the output changes among sectors is maintained in all cases.\n",
    "    - When the results of the sensitivity analysis satisfy both viewpoints, we may well conclude that simulation results are robust. \n",
    "    - If only one of the two is satisfied, robustness is less evident"
